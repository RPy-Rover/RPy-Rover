# RPy-Rover

                             Euro RPi-Rover Project
                             ----------------------

The RPy-Rover is a tracked vehicle controlled by a Raspberry Pi running a Python program.

Inspired by Sojourner, the rover of the Mars PathFinder project that allowed us to
travel the plains of the red planet, the RPy-Rover is equipped with a Xbee radio that
enables it to receive commands from a command centre and send back the data it
collets with it’s camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, ranger and GPS modules.

Visit the project's blog for tutorials and the story of the project:

The program structure is described at:

Code will be published whenever we integrate a module into the final system and
complete integration testing for that module.
